/*We can log order types such as arrays, variables,objects */

//variables and declarions

/* 
keywords used in variables : var, let, const
We can reassign variables when we use var and let
rules: 
    variables can contain letters, numbers, _ , currency
    it cannot start with numbers
    "$name" as a variable name is used mainly in jquery
const statement means constant the variable cannot be assigned another value, const has to be assigned a value when initialized. In the case of objects and arrays, we can assign a new value with the constant entity declared for objects(
    const = person {
        name : "joe",
        age : 12
    }
    The values within like name can be changed with the syntax : person.name = "jal" but we cannot write the entity person again with new values within
)
The same thing applies to arrays we can add new values to it but we cannot write out the entity again assigning new values.
